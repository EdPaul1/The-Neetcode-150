Contents

The NeetCode 150 repository contains the following sections:

    Questions: This section includes a list of 150 coding interview questions. Each question is carefully selected to reflect the types of problems commonly encountered in technical interviews.

    Solutions: In this section, you'll find sample solutions to the interview questions. These solutions are provided in various programming languages, making it easier for you to understand and implement them in your preferred language.

    Explanations: For many questions, you'll also find detailed explanations that walk you through the thought process and the steps to solve the problem. Understanding the reasoning behind a solution is crucial for acing technical interviews.

    Contributing: If you have a new question or solution that you'd like to add to NeetCode 150, you can follow the guidelines in this section to contribute to the repository and help fellow developers prepare for interviews.

How to Use NeetCode 150

    Explore the Questions: Start by going through the list of questions to get a sense of the topics covered. Pick questions that align with your interview preparation needs.

    Review Solutions: Once you attempt a question, refer to the solutions section to see how the problem can be solved. Try to understand the logic and coding patterns used in the provided solutions.

    Practice, Practice, Practice: The key to success in technical interviews is practice. Implement the solutions on your own, and try to solve the questions without looking at the solutions once you've understood the approach.

    Learn from Explanations: For a deeper understanding, read the explanations provided. These explanations break down the thought process and approach to solving each problem.

    Contribute: If you come across a question that isn't in the list or have a better solution to an existing problem, consider contributing to the repository to help others in their interview preparation journey.
